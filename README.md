# Introduction
This is a dashboard created following Keith Galli's tutorial on Youtube [Build Awesome Web Apps & Dashboards with Python! (Full Shiny for Python Course)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LG4KffeCgg&t=145s&ab_channel=KeithGalli). I strongly recommend watching this tutorial from Keith, where he explains how to create a dashboard, how to add style, reactivity and how to deploy it.  

I deployed the dashboard on [shinyapps.io] (https://www.shinyapps.io/) , you can check it out here: [US Cities Sales Dashboard](https://israrm.shinyapps.io/us-cities-sales-dashboard/).

### Questions
The dashboard uncovers the following questions:
* What is the yearly sales distribution by city?
* What products are top sellers and worst sellers by total amount and by value?
* What is the distribution of sales by hours and by days of the week?
* What is the geographical distribution of sales across the US cities?

# Tools

For this analysis I used the following tools:

-**Pandas**.\
-**Seaborn**.\
-**Altair**.\
-**Folium**.\
-**Plotly**.\
-**Shiny for Python**.\
-**Visual Studio Code**.\
-**Git & GitHub**.

# Key Findings

* Cities in the west like Los Angeles and San Francisco lead in sales over eastern cities like Boston and New York.
* Unsurprisingly, December is the highest selling month.
* AAA and AA batteries are the top selling products by quantity but when it comes to value, Apple products dominate with MacBook Pro laptops being the top selling product by total value.
* The majority of sales orders fall within the interval between 10 am and 9 pm.
